# Impact-of-climate-change-and-food-security-
üåç Predicting Climate Change Impact on Agriculture
Overview
This Flask-based web application predicts the impact of climate change on agriculture and assesses its implications for food security. Using machine learning models, it analyzes key factors such as temperature, precipitation, farmers' inputs, pesticide usage, fertilizer application, crop yield, and soil health to provide actionable insights for farmers and agricultural stakeholders.

By addressing critical challenges posed by climate change, this tool empowers farmers to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and enhance crop productivity while ensuring sustainable agricultural practices.

Key Features
üìä Data Analysis: Integrates multiple factors affecting crop yield and food security.
üå°Ô∏è Climate Prediction: Accounts for temperature and precipitation trends to analyze potential risks.
üöú Resource Optimization: Provides recommendations for the efficient use of pesticides, fertilizers, and other inputs.
üå± Soil Health Assessment: Includes insights to maintain and improve soil quality for long-term benefits.
üåæ Crop Yield Prediction: Helps farmers plan crops based on predicted yield under varying conditions.
Why This Tool Matters
Precision Agriculture: Improves resource allocation and boosts productivity.
Risk Mitigation: Prepares farmers for extreme weather conditions and climate risks.
Sustainability: Promotes eco-friendly agricultural practices.
Food Security: Addresses global challenges related to food availability and distribution.
How It Works
